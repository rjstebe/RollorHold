# Roll Or Hold

Roll or Hold is a calculator that lets a player of a game of Yahtzee or Yam-Slam input their current dice, rolls remaining, and score options. The calculator automatically calculates which dice the player should hold and which they should keep to obtain the highest score for the turn.
